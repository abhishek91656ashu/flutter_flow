# A Grahak App 
This case study explores the use of FlutterFlow, a no-code development platform, in creating the Grahak app. The Grahak app was developed to provide a minimalistic user experience, enabling users to perform financial transactions, such as entering Aadhaar card details, bank information, and generating QR codes. This initiative was aimed at understanding FlutterFlow's capabilities, its integration potential with the existing Spice Money Flutter app, and evaluating its advantages and limitations in a real-world application.
